            Daguerreotype of Edgar Allan Poe, known as the "Annie" Daguerreotype
        </p>
        <p>Edgar Allan Poe (born Edgar Poe; January 19, 1809 â€“ October 7, 1849) was an American author, poet, editor,
            and literary critic, considered part of the American Romantic Movement. Best known for his tales of mystery
            and the macabre, Poe was one of the earliest American practitioners of the short story, and is generally
            considered the inventor of the detective fiction genre. He is further credited with contributing to the
            emerging genre of science fiction.[1] He was the first well-known American writer to try to earn a living
            through writing alone, resulting in a financially difficult life and career.[2]</p>

        <p>Born in Boston, Poe was the second child of two actors. His father abandoned the family in 1810, and his
            mother died the following year. Thus orphaned, the child was taken in by John and Frances Allan, of
            Richmond, Virginia. Although they never formally adopted him, Poe was with them well into young adulthood.
            Tension developed later as John Allan and Edgar repeatedly clashed over debts, including those incurred by
            gambling, and the cost of secondary education for the young man. Poe attended the University of Virginia
            for one semester but left due to lack of money. Poe quarreled with Allan over the funds for his education
            and enlisted in the Army in 1827 under an assumed name. It was at this time his publishing career began,
            albeit humbly, with an anonymous collection of poems, Tamerlane and Other Poems (1827), credited only to "a
            Bostonian". With the death of Frances Allan in 1829, Poe and Allan reached a temporary rapprochement. Later
            failing as an officer's cadet at West Point and declaring a firm wish to be a poet and writer, Poe parted
            ways with John Allan.</p>

        <p>Poe switched his focus to prose and spent the next several years working for literary journals and
            periodicals, becoming known for his own style of literary criticism. His work forced him to move among
            several cities, including Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New York City. In Baltimore in 1835, he married
            Virginia Clemm, his 13-year-old cousin. In January 1845 Poe published his poem, "The Raven", to instant
            success. His wife died of tuberculosis two years after its publication. For years, he had been planning to
            produce his own journal, The Penn (later renamed The Stylus), though he died before it could be produced.
            On October 7, 1849, at age 40, Poe died in Baltimore; the cause of his death is unknown and has been
            variously attributed to alcohol, brain congestion, cholera, drugs, heart disease, rabies, suicide,
            tuberculosis, and other agents.[3]</p>

        <p>Poe and his works influenced literature in the United States and around the world, as well as in specialized
            fields, such as cosmology and cryptography. Poe and his work appear throughout popular culture in
            literature, music, films, and television. A number of his homes are dedicated museums today. The Mystery
            Writers of America present an annual award known as the Edgar Award for distinguished work in the mystery
            genre.</p>
